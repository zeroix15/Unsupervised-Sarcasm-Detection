(i figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)in fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it. \n","that's is ridiculously poor logic. simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. the us government is way more corrupt than the catholic church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do. \n","well, many have argued that if you don't except a literal genesis, you're damned. perhaps not in this particular thread, but the arguments are esentially the same. i believe that the theological implications of that position are fair game for discussing the validity of creationism. \n","believe me, marc, we certainly can. the fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs. in fact, it damns your argument so much that the producers know it. see below. \n","darling, i'm in the 10th year of my committed relationship. and since i haven't seen anything approaching his perfection, i think not. but thank you, though. i asked the question because enquiring minds want to know...if you have a 'hair stylist', ifn you not gay, then you metro. you don't want the label, then don't divulge that bit of info.\n","anyone who serves in the military is a hero. once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath, you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime. perhaps others didn't get the recognition she got, but that's not her fault. the media needed a 'darling of enduring freedom' poster child and she got picked.\n","his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you.\n","you're a darling, j. coulda used you here earlier, though, to straighten this mess out. as far as 'stalking' goes, btw, my first appearance here was 11/08/94 (the same day i told those on the ny times board about this forum. ) the poster in question (infamous on the same board, though he pretends not to be) first appeared on 11/16/04. who's stalking whom?\n","darling, it isn't an analogy at all. as duo correctly observed, it is a counter. when faced with a choice between human life and animal life, one should not automatically choose the human. why is abortion worse than eating bacon and eggs? because we like babies more. not because human life is worth more, or more valuable in any way, just because we like babies more.  personally, when faced with the choice of buying dog food or sponsoring a child in africa, i choose to feed my dog. because i like my dog more than i like people i don't know.\n","*shudder* for whom the bell tolls might be the most horrid book ever devised. junior year english took a lot out of me. an excerpt from the book, paraphrased to the best of my memory: 'darling.'

the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.\n","gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.\n","you calling me a diseased freak ?

(insert campfire song here) and that a lot of them fear a theistic government that limits freedom.\n","heh. i'm amused that we both put 'massage' in quotes.\n","you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.\n","i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.\n","why do you seem to have such an bone to pick with capitalism? it would be different if there were a proven superior system out there, but there isn't. capitalism isn't perfect, but it's the best we really have without giving way too much power to government. but i'm even more fascinated at how you tie religion to government policy like socialism or capitalism. i find that a rather strange mindset. i tend to think of religion an more of an individual thing rather than something to fuel government programs. a comment on capitalism doesn't really even belong in a discussion on satanism.\n","i'm not making fun of you lol i'm honestly amazed at how different people can be though the same age.  and srom, it's the internet. don't take anything you read off the internet seriously. and have you realized that maybe it's you that's the problem? i mean not the problem, but causing it. you may want to refine your debating techniques if you want respect on this site.\n","im not by any means generalising about men and women at all. but i'm honestly surprised that you have never met people that think this way. i personally know lots of people that pride themselves of being a 'player'. how could you not be aware of this? as for women, the majority of women i've come into contact with are seeking long-term to permanent relationships. often they find themselves being 'played' by guys who are after just one thing, and they sometimes are unfortunate to end up a single mother, while the dad continues to be a 'rolling stone' as for ideals, what i describe is no ideal by any stretch of the imagination. men that pursue women just for a one-night-stand are everywhere. im still baffled that you think i'm making this up\n","this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog.\n","oh, good! but on a side note, keep up the new generation of education. your students are lucky, this in my opinion is the best was to truly learn and grasp an idea. i'm impressed that you took a step beyond the text book. keep up the good work!\n","bravo, i'm impressed (i tried to come up with some clever rhyme but i couldn't think of anything)\n","i noticed..., you got a public apology. i'm impressed ;)\n","i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy\n","if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?\n","i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?\n","alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?\n","i'm intrigued, can you give one or two examples off of the top of your head?  good point as to the 2nd paragraph.\n","sorry dude, these links are either vague or irrelevant to the topic, the abstract to the phd thesis is on the guy's own website and doesn't give a link to the actual work. i'm not stating this doesn't happen, i'm just intrigued by the possibility and i don't buy into anything unless i can see some verified, hopefully peer-reviewed work, any search on google for these names doesn't give anything of value.\n","ya it's true, it was pretty hilarious. i'm just surprised he only got 7 days and a $1,000 fine. it is only single a minor leagues, but that was rediculous.\n","proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution.\n","i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available.\n","i'm not talking about talk radio, i'm talking about rctv, the venezuelan station that had its licence withdrawn. i'm saying that if a us station were advocating the violent overthrow of the government, as rctv did, then it would lose its licence in a flash, not the 5 years the venezuelan government put up with it. i'm kind of amused by the idea of hillary clinton being a socialist though...\n","to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best.\n","inasmuch as the idea of substantive due process is a contradiction in terms, i'm not all that surprised that it's history is quite complicated. the idea of substantive due process was indeed invented by judges, which just goes to show one thing: if it needed to be invented after the constitution was ratified, it wasn't part of the constitution to begin with. in other words, because the idea of substantive due process was not contemplated by the framers or ratifiers of the constitution, it is not a legitimate doctrine.\n","the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference\n","the catholic position on evolution always seemed to me a rather supine cop-out, and i'm not at all surprised that some catholics are re-examining it. cardinal schonborn in his nyt article wrote schonborn has a fearsome reputation as an intellectual, but his demand that any scientific treatment of evolutionary theory has to start with an a priori assumption of design does not say a lot for his understanding of science.\n","i'm not enthralled to go to school. i really don't enjoy the experience. i do, though, know that it would be better for me and everyone else that goes to school. we can't depend on our country just being good, we have to actually do something to make it that way. education is the easiest way to do that. and, just for the record, i do go to summer school. where i live, summer school is only two periods per day, and i can only take certain classes. it really sucks. but, we have to look at the big picture. i don't like many of my classes, and i don't like many of my teachers. but i'm not going to sacrifice my education for comfort or the ability to relax, at least not in high school.  think about it. i'm sure you'd agree.\n","no they can't. their gods are the god of this world, and his name is satan. that's the problem with cults, they deceive and lead to death, not life. but i'll agree that the darkness has spiritual power, but nothing good can come of it. you know what's sad ? i'm not even surprised you would list wiccan as a valid religion that actually represents life and goodness.\n","i completely agree. this school's decision is ridiculous to say the least but the sad part is that i'm not even surprised by this. this sort of thing seems to be happening more and more lately.\n","would you consider yourself philosophical? no, i don't think philosophy is useful. everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games, like the ontological argument. lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever, and i'm not impressed with philosophy's lack of demonstrative capabilities.\n","the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway. 'we could blow up a u.s. ship in guantanamo bay... omg. couple of cia guys brainstorming for solutions to a problem and people go nuts. if that's the worst of what they contemplated...i'm not impressed.  i'm sure conspiracies happen all the time but they are so rare as to be insignifigant. my wife and i can't even agree on a restaurant.\n","i'm not incredulous because miller isn't here, i'm incredulous that not a single one of the 'millions of other religious evolutionists' are here.\n","i'm not in the least surprised.. i stated that it was required by law.. i never said anything about when it became a requirement. as of now, in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required.. would you say that is an invasion of privacy?..  and for your information clinton wasn't the first or last president to rape the social security program.. politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades.\n","not that i was interested in joining them, but i did read the two links. i'm not much surprised that science has nothing to do with it...and not at all surprised that many actors are into it...hollywood has long been known to generate kooks. i suppose they are just a small portion of the total, but they are very publicized.\n","i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.\n","while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist.\n","as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.\n","i'm not surprised that you would hold that opinion, but studies show that a troubled relationship with two parents is better than a single parent situation.  http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/custody.html http://www.civitas.org.uk/pubs/experiments.php \n","that makes sense since howard would not answer whether jesus is god or not. good catch! most attacks on true christianity center around who jesus is and whether or not the bible is the word of god. so i'm not surprised that's what we're dealing with. jesus is god!\n","well, i'm not surprised. the left coast rarely gets anything right. :)  btw, gm still has over 25% of the domestic vehicle market and it didn't get it by selling econoboxes like the japanese did.\n","well right now it's 20 minutes to the deadline, but i'm not optomistic. he hasn't logged in since my last post. i sent him a pm yesterday warning him that he had 24 hours, but since he hasn't logged in, i'm not surprised he didn't get it. if you can't stick to the deadline we agreed to before, you shouldn't have agreed to a formal debate. i'm sorry to say that i'm a little frustrated. although there is the chance that a miracle will occur and he will post in the next 20 minutes. but i'm not exactly holding out hope.\n","that's ...... well i'm not surprised really. have you ever watched 2 1/2 men? it's content is all about charlie's character's sex life.\n","i thought the book was one of the most boring pieces of fiction i've ever read. i didn't finish it.  i'm not surprised that the movie version is a point of controversy. christians don't take well to versions of their belief system that question dogma, even those vehicles intended as general entertainment.\n","no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status.\n","find me a spell check plugin for firefox liminus. i had one for ie before i switched over.  frankly, i'm not surprised we're going to use that for police and military applications.\n","i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb.\n","as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow.\n","you'd be surprised. i'm sure something else will come up in the future that makes bs's nationalization seem quaint. still, it is pretty horrific what the fed did to the public. nationalization of debt while almost giving away revenue generating assets. seriously.  what is disturbing is that the american public just sat there while their government saddled them with additional debt that has no rational future revenues. but given the peanut gallery here, i'm not surprised the rest of the nation is as ignorant.  but as i spoke to symbiote, the next crisis will be much worse. we haven't solved ****. it's a poor quality band-aid, if that.\n","this guy's flip-flopped more times than i can count. i'm not surprised, nor will i be if he fails to follow through on his words.\n","i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story. \n","thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.\n","i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.\n","that's interesting, because all of the things the bible apparently says about them is left to be intentionally vague and unanswered. for example - 'the bible, however, makes it plain that dinosaurs and people must have lived together. actually, as we will soon see, there is a lot of evidence for this.' great. now, where in the bible does it say this? because science has disproven that dinosaurs and humans lived together through carbon dating. that's a fact. the link you gave me cites zero scientific evidence, only incredibly far stretches of what the bible says. so, you've given me no proof. i'm not surprised.\n","he'll get to you eventually, he's doing them in order of points. lol though i'm disappointed to say that a lot of people, including myself, are starting to lose interest in the roasts. i'm not surprised though, because there's a lot of inactive users.\n","brooke got the boot! i'm not surprised, her performances last night were weak.\n","finally an other conservative in this site. i mean who do these people think they are? trying to pass amendments like the fairness act. but i'm not surprised that some order is coming back to are leaders. when the government swings to far to one side, (in this case left) its ganna swing back to the other side, we just as conservatives, need to make sure we don't go to right, or we'll have done just as bad as the liberals.\n","looks like you're right. the movie scored #1 this weekend earning some $23 million. i guess i'm not too surprised since the johnny depp talk seems to have cooled down already.\n","i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though.\n","pretty damn disgusting. i'm quite surprised that you've never heard of it. i didn't think that it was still all that novel.\n","it depends on who's determining that it 'is not favorable'. it can be biased if the judge of it is biased.  a round earth is something we can observe in the here and now. i'm really surprised the 'flat earth' label is still tossed around by evolutionists today. it was used by evolutionists as early as the nineteenth century as a method of ridiculing christians. the fact is, most belief in a flat earth disappeared by the fifteenth century. the fact that evolutionists still use it is an indicator of the insecurity they have in themselves.  likewise, evolutionists have squat for origins, for the simplest forms of life. you'd think that after spending billions evolutionists would be able to come up with something for a foundation for their beliefs. but no - not one.\n","really??! it's stated, very clearly in the creeds. i'm somewhat surprised by this.\n","...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers.\n","you know full well that isn't what i said at all. i was pointing out the difference between dogma and church teaching. for the most part, as much as i ususally disagree with you, you are quite reasonable and know your facts before entering into a discussion. that's why i'm so surprised at you here. so what? there are hundreds of laws out there on the books that don't actually get enforced anymore. old hangers-on from a 150 years ago taht never got changed. just because it technically could happen doesn't mean it is relevant anymore.\n","the aruba case fuelled a lot of bad blood around here. to be honest i'm still astonished about the whole thing. what idiot starts verbally assaulting wartime allies over a missing person's case?\n","yea - i'm still fascinated by the stories i'm told about wakan-tanka (great spirit), winter man, coyote, and other beliefs of the lakhota people. i wish i had the time to learn more of their traditions and beliefs. i could literally sit and listen for hours. unfortunately, i was just passing through the dakotas (town called bullhead or bull head?) and had to leave. i needed one of their of sweat lodge treatments at the time  real bad:)\n","i'm surprised no one has mentioned this guy before now: http://epedia.pbworks.com/f/platypusc-2.jpeg\n","really?? i'm surprised you would want it to be true.\n","jim and ghost, i think you both missed my point. my fault, i should have been more clear. total disarmament was never my intention.  my point was, what kind of military might do you think it would take to pacify loosely organized militias of americans fighting an islamic occupier? at what cost? do you think they could ever completely subdue the insurgent force?  i don't, because i know i'd rather die than live under a regime that was everything i despised. when you're fighting for your way of life, your religion, or even your perceived freedom, continued motivation will never be a problem. you could take all the guns out of iraq, the insurgents would be throwing rocks at the american soldiers and each other. waxy ps - i must say i'm surprised at both of your stances on the 2nd amendment, i agree with you jim.\n","with the way things are going for all the networks, jim, i'm surprised he's lasted as long as he did. his methods were deemed obsolete even before all the controversy. but, i like him. at least he's going out in style - march, i believe - the anniversary (40th ??) when he took over for walter. too bad one bobble got him thrown into the dungeon.\n","though bush, in this case, was quoting abraham lincoln, i'm surprised not to have seen any comments regarding his references to god. especially in...

i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district.\n","i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised.\n","well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same.\n","allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure.\n","kudos, snakespit. i'm surprised that i'm saying that to you.\n","for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?\n","so as to comics/cartoons that have already been mentioned: calvin and hobbes, simpsons, south park, recess, and sponge bob rock my socks off. also pretty much all of adult swim. but i'm surprised no one mentioned this... the fairly odd parents... hella funny ****... oh my god.  that's it for me\n","this is not good news at all. i'm guessing that there will be a lot of trouble in the near future. one thing that i would not recommend, and i'm surprised that you would even suggest it given your stance on others having an opinion about american elections, is the us getting more involved in there election process. pakistan has to be, and be seen to be, uncompromised in this process. smiley\n","1st, i never said it was only geography. second .... stats please, regarding your new claim here? so you do think they are inversely proportional. (can't say i'm surprised, it's a view consistent with anti-religious prejudice.) there are plenty of christian scientists with phds that would, i suspect, disagree with you. and i have no idea what your point is on the homeschooling comment. homeschoolers often do better academically.\n","i hope it's obama too, but i will vote for clinton if necessary although i don't really trust her to end the war quickly.  (i must say i'm surprised that there is so little interest in discussing politics on this site given the huge number of comments elsewhere.)\n","i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.\n","he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.\n","and a lot of cosmetic surgery. you know, i'm surprised not more comparisons are done with vet care. i had my cat sliced open and a bunch of samples taken and a billion tests and 3-4 nights in the special vet hospital at a vet school. it cost me a fortune! something like $650 bucks. the same procedure which is done in humans (for cancer) costs over $100,000 from what i found out. now you'd expect it to be a lot more but really that much more?\n","many americans feel that deploying our military in our own cities as a police force sets a bad precedent. i'm surprised you don't. it's one thing to use them in the case of a natural disaster where local police might be overwhelmed, but to open a shooting war with street gangs? chicago ain't rio de janeiro.\n","the reason that halo has been restricted to xbox is because microsoft bought bungie. they want to give people a reason to get a 360. that reason? halo. modern warfare, on the other hand, is owned by neither microsoft or sony. quite frankly i'm surprised that nintendo doesn't own everything already.\n","people are destroyed mentally for life and some even kill them selves.due to what happened to them becuase it was so traumatic and most get away with one and do it again some even start killing thier victims so yea .i'm surprised that you are sticking up for rapists\n","1. no, she has a choice, abort or keep and support the child. 2. no, it makes a woman take responsibility for her body, like keeping her legs together. i'm surprised more people aren't in favor of this.\n","i've only had a quick look as i'm on the bus so research is limited but i'm sure the evidence for the 2000 year old israel is biblical, so is the promise from god which is what the modern israel is based on. i thought you thought the bible was stupid bronze age myths for creatards so i'm surprised to see you basing an argument on this. before the modern israel was created the land was part of palestine making it palestinian before it was jewish unless you go by biblical evidence and gods promise.\n","this is some thing we can agree on.  many women think it's a legal right to kill their children with abortion and people like me see it as a crime against humanity.  frankly, i'm surprised there are not even more debates created about it.\n","true, and i'm surprised no one has brought up resources... if there is x amount of a certain resource that we need to survive then when we reach an x amount of people, we could be factually overpopulated although i don't know how any such thing could be measured.\n","to be honest i was playing devils advocate i'm surprised more people did'nt comment!!!\n","i'm sure i will get bored with the site long before 13000 points. lol! i'm surprised he hasn't.\n","there are tax exemptions for a married couple which a gay person cannot get. that's taxation with unequal representation at the very least. you can't argue the logic of gay marriage, only weird theories of morality. i'm surprised you're attempting this.\n","i support you on these things, however christians are considered warlike as an artifact of the crusades. in which they killed plenty of people (crusades are similar to jihad fyi).  however that idea is outdated. this debate could very easily turn into a useless flamefest like most here on religion. also i'm surprised you didn't use machiavellian in your argument to describe those men. edit: what about iran? the iran-iraq war was clearly a religious war.\n","i told you twice. i'm surprised you didn't get the message?\n","totally agree. i'm surprised to see how many people think it's funny.\n","1. i don't want criminals killed. you have no way of knowing what my wants are and i have never been so arrogant as to tell you what your wants are. 2. you are entitled to be wrong but you aren't entitled to your own facts. children in the womb are just as alive as you are. your denials of that fact not with standing.  3. your reasoning is flawed because you remove the component or aspect of guilt or innocence and substitute wants in p ace of it. your denial of the fact that it (a child in the womb) is alive is a huge red flag on that.  i'm surprised that more pro-aborts don't call you on it.\n","intangible i'm surprised at you from what i've seen your very fair in your debating style, and i understand you don't want to see more suffering, but do you not think there might be a better way ?\n","i'm surprised that you disagree, seeing as how you've seen the hills have eyes. i'd say hills have eyes was one of the more disturbing films.\n","real version ?

i'm surprised mixx is cd rather than cg.\n"," i'm surprised. you're saying those are political systems? and that they work well historically?  i'm saying that they operate like political systems, with the leaders of each respective religion issuing edicts that the followers are expected to obey, and often at the penalty of social repercussions if they do not. i measure effectiveness in the ability of the system to survive and spread.\n","no david, soc wouldn't be on a separate part of this site. he proved his mettle time and time again. the problem is becoming constant and i'm surprised you hadn't noticed. since the terrible incidents with repubgal, 14 years of age and involving the abortion/pro-choice debates, i've been able to simply sniff them out...and every time i feel i should look at the profile..bammmmm!!! i'm right with the exception of some that take my breath away because they know so very much at such a young age.\n","well... like i said, considering how many people are sharing earth, i would think we would get a long a lot less than we do. i'm not saying we do get a long very well, but i'm saying i'm surprised we get along as well as we do.. you understand?\n","i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.\n","is it that this has already been discussed a lot elsewhere? if that's the case, let me know. otherwise, i'm very surprised people aren't talking about this. simone? anyone?\n","i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.\n","i also love it when people look at the world reasonably.\n","jitobear, i always love it when you post. you are succinct and to the point and i always wish i had said what you said.\n","this might surprise you but i find you quite impressive as well. despite my criticisms, i am absolutely impressed with how you are able to consider a diversity of views, which, i must say, you are getting a lot better at.\n","honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam.\n","i am amazed you think al gore is lsong the debate last time i checked he has a global scientific consensus supporting his position, you know that means that the majority of the worlds scientists. http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm \n","i see why you would think this, and i am amazed by some of the people who have children, but it may be used as population control, and that's not right. i do think that it would be worthwhile to perhaps do evaluations, but people could lie, and corruption could take the entire thing way out of control.\n","again i am astounded by the fact that you think i will endanger children. it is a topic sunset, so why are you calling me demented and sick.  would you agree that everybody in this world is different? everybody thoughts are different. so when someone has different views than your own, you have the nerve to say they are sick.  i know i called you sick. but i said it purposely because you called me sick for foolish reason.  my problem is that i hate it when people call me sick and demented. that is not the person i am and to be hated on this site for my views is completely stupid. i hate the fact that i can't be 'accepted' because of my views.\n","yes its overused a lot but i think the company that needs to take a break and work on things is infinity ward because they don't have as good as games the only game i enjoyed from the cod franchise is mw2 and that was amazing they did a good job on it, but for mw3 all they did was use the same graphics and everything from mw2 except new campaign, spec ops mission, multiplayer weapons and perks and killstreak options but to me they did a horrible job for mw3. they need to stop for 1 year, and come up with ideas to make a better infinity ward game. i am impressed with treyarch and what they did!\n","yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.\n","that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  think about a specific statement that you think you can prove through a series of logical arguments regardless of your personal feelings on the subject and invite me to a private debate on it. i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course.\n","it is not appropriate on this site to call people names. i understand that you are still learning in school and are busy, but i think that they taught basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16, so there is really no excuse! i did take the time to google your school, but you are too young to realize that maybe this is not the only coolidge hs in the country... so i went with the first google result... i am not impressed, the school gets a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 stars from parents!\n","i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.\n","i am overwhelmed watching phelps. he is totally part man part fish. i also think that his attitude shows through, he seems to be highly upbeat and still very focused on the goals which he has set for himself.  jesse owens had his time and place and will never be forgotten. he opened the door for all the wonderful black athletes we see at almost every event at the olympics. but today, right now, phelps is the man.\n","if you want to get rid of them, i know a falconer in your state (iirc you are in texas) who would probably like to come and trap that coopers for you. i keep a red tail and a coopers hawk and he was up not long ago (he keeps a falcon) and we went out quail hunting on horseback. he was extremely impressed with the coopers dash-and-kill ability.  if it was me, i would just sacrifice the few birds that it kills in order to be able to watch the hawks...but then i am partial to raptors.\n","paul.boys, thank you for this little historical footnote. i must add that i am quite shocked to learn of this but not surprised. i think that in now disapproving as a society of child prostitution shows that we have advanced socially--and i argue that it has to do with becoming a more secular society and granting more rights and equality to women and children--as opposed to the almost divinely conferred 'father' right often practiced in old christianity before it was forced to reform by feminism.\n","now, if we're talking natural insemination by donor, that would likely be morally unacceptable in most circles, though certainly not all. really? i mean that sincerely. sometimes i am really surprised by what people find immoral. most people seriously object to that? why? o.o\n","i don't think i am shocked, i am scared! lol\n","i am trying to become a going in to college for pre-med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses. not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers, but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers. by trying to help everyone in the short term, he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term.\n","no, did you? i don't get why this debate seems to have pissed you off, but it is rather perplexing. i say that everyone deserves human rights; children and adults. am i wrong? i say that privacy is a human right. am i wrong? therefore, privacy is deserved by all human beings; children and adults. am i wrong? get over any issues you may have had, because one person's issues with privacy does not ultimately relate to every other child in the entire world; this is an obvious fact in life and i am shocked that you do not understand this.\n","i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site.\n","actually, quite correct. i am surprised. i woudl have thought you more of the relativistic type.\n","i am surprised i am going out on a limb saying that i dont think we will find them now. it is possible he dispensed with them to terrorists when we attacked..\n","i am surprised people wanted m-80s and stuff like that legal. they accounted for most of the injuries due to fireworks and most of the fires. probably not a smart idea to have them.\n","i am surprised a little to see providence college on the list....they are not gay friendly but they do have a gay straigtht alliance and an office of gay studies....i am from providence so i have been there.\n","i am surprised that some of the more conservative christians are not weighing in on source of some of the christian terminology and concepts.\n","bassman: i am surprised by most of your recent posts of late. i site this one example above. i am bothered that you posted this rhetoric again. i gave you the statistics and the government websites that support those statistics, that show the millions of people raised from poverty since 1968. from over 22% of the us population in the early 1970s to fewer than 10% in the 1990s, and yet you continue to misinform. you claim to be a christian and mislead just like the scribes and pharisees of jesus day. to purposefully misrepresent the facts is the antithesis of christian behavior and brings into question your very claim to christianity as well as makes suspect your personal agenda which seems much more counterfeit than you would like people to know.\n","my parents moved to shawnee not long ago. when i was a kid, anything west of lenexa was considered too close to desoto, and a little suspect :) i was up that way not long ago, and even deoto is fairly respectable now :) :)  i am surprised there are so many here from kansas. there is somebody here from lenexa as well.\n","i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination.\n","i tend to agree; i am surprised some regulars here seem to intend on even giving this poster the time of day and converse with him after the stuff posted the other night.\n","libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised.\n","i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust.\n","as sharp as you are, i am surprised you missed my sarcasm. it happens. we do usually like to stir things up when it interests us. we sell weapons to taiwan and israel.  well then we have nothing to worry about. i didn't say that. we should be concerned by how much money is poured into these black ops programs. i support them, but i am concerned about over spending on them.\n","can you believe the stupidity of those who think it acutally is not sex?

so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents.\n","oh thanks i guess it was you who have been upvoting my arguements huh ?

do you oppose funding nasa?  but abortion is quite different from any of those because it's giving people the right to kill something that is living. the government also supports hunting, granting hunting licenses to millions of individuals. the animals being hunted have a far greater ability to feel pain and emotions than the fetus in the womb being aborted.  i cannot see why the government should be able to legalize something that is clearly wrong, playing god in the process. because it's not clearly wrong. there are other opinions out there other than your own. all you seek to do is deprive people of their choice, and impose your will upon the masses. let's all be glad you are not in a position of power, for you would abuse it undeniably all in the name of 'god'.\n","14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.\n","i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers.\n","this is what your arguement would look like if you were talking about gun control: 'i'm pro-choice because when there's a threat in my neighbourhood, i want to chose whether or not i will buy a gun or not. i am not pro-guns because i don't want to be forced to buy the gun when there is a theat in my neighbourhood. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-gun, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all buy a gun!' i don't want a gun. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal.' the only choice pro-life and 'pro-choice' disagree on is whether there should be a right to abort in certain circumstances.\n","agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along\n","oh really?

is it when alcohol, marijuana and whatever you can come up with is legalized without age limit? how is that freedom. how is it freedom to be forced to live in a smoke that kills you. i don't understand you people.. to become a free country, legalize everything. legalize murder, legalize robbery.. as long as you feel free, who cares about others?\n","i am well aware (and sympathetic) to your hatred of jews, negros, gays, gypsies, etc.; but i am shocked and dismayed at your ignorance (and/or) intolerance of hermaphrodites.  hitler; you sir, have lost my respect.\n","oh do go on. i am so impressed by your 'intellectuall' argument. pfft.\n","of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever?

unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy.\n","i love how you voted true and then tried to challenge the idea. priceless! this is not exactly the same as any of my other debates at all - and this is not about assigning labels. but since you raise the issue, as labels go, the word 'fetus' is the label and 'child' is what the child actually is.  the word fetus is just a label used to mark the stage of life and development that the animal (in this case a human being) is in.  you can see by the comments so far.... it's still a very difficult thing to get pro-aborts to accept.\n","i love how many of the far rights love to say they're independant because they disagree with like maybe one republican issue, or because they have a general mistrust of government... yet on every issue (besides maybe the one) and every vote they are lock and step with the conservatives. michael savage is a far right conservative commentator. that's what he is. you can tell because all of his listeners are far right conservatives, or independants who fit into the category i described above. and you can also tell because he falls on either the conservative side of every single issue, or even further right of the conservative side of every issue. while i'm sure it helps sane conservatives sleep at night to think that hate-mongering lunatic isn't of their ilk, i'm afraid it just isn't true.\n","i love how you christian apologists repel in horror when you hear about muslim or jewish atrocities, and yet you don't even flinch when someone talks about the rape, murder, genocide, lying, deceit and homophobia committed by your god.  the spanish inquisition was an attempt to maintain catholic indoctrination through violence. you clearly feel asleep in history class. didn't do your homework, did you? i'm not going to deny that people have been influenced positively by christianity, but it's ludicrous to suggest that no bad things have come out of it. ever heard of a little something called to holocaust?\n","lol, i love how everyone seems to feel the need to out-wit rk even after over 50 days xd\n","i love how you ignore all logic, reason, morality, and all rationality. how can you say my arguments are wrong if you will not go through piece by piece and dispute me? if im so wrong, why do you just say that and not actually show that i am wrong.  you hope that one day ill be capable of rational thought? coming from the guy who believes in a magic sky daddy from a fairytale book. oh how silly of me to reject something that i have yet to find any shred of significant evidence for. oh what a fool ive been\n","loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh??

he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.\n","uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!\n","wow! i am soooooooo amazed by your come back skills... another epic fail!\n","i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.\n","i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes\n","i am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity. and, we must not forget the elvis believers too\n","seriously though simone. clinton has a record of forcing himself upon women . i am surprised that you have any time for him. bet you like teddy kennedy too!\n","there is no limit to what chuck norris can do. i am surprised he hasn't broken into your house for talking to him like that. but perhaps the kindness in his heart makes him better than that. jesus is a hippy, so i don't see how he could take him on. there is no limit to what jesus christ can do. i am suprised that jesus christ hasn't taken your soul since you compare a god to a mortal. but he still loves you and wants to be in a relationship with him. chuck norris is a mortal, i don't know how he can defeat a god.\n","i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is. well done.\n","i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?\n","i love how point-whoring/farming is allowed when it's in the form of this.\n","i love how you reply without putting any thought into your post, it is awesome. the answer to my question was no. your computer screen is not absorbing light from the sun and reflecting the color yellow back to you. thanks for playing, you lose. we know you don't actually believe in science, so you can stop trying to quote it.\n","i love how i am getting under your skin. it really amuses me and your wish is my command.\n","i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.\n","i love how you managed to make a counter-troll sound like a serious reply :)\n","i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes\n","i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin?

things he can't do.\n","and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double
